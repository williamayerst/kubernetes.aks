Draft
draftpacks will build code into Dockerfile for you, following best practise

to debug, adjust dockerfile
 - change --configuration from release to debug
 - install vsdbg 

adjust .vscode launch.json pipe transport to docker image > /vsdbg/vsdbg

Helm charts generated by Draft are those which are used in the overall pipeline

default Helm charts are used for internal development loop, typically will fail.

devops/etc. will adjust those in CI/CD i.e. values.yaml and related templates

build:
use private agent for build, package and hand over to release

release:
handing off tarball file, tasks are install heml, helm init, helm upgrade, arguments in upgrade for secrets/values/etc.
